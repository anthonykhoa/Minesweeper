Minesweeper done with the same functions, except written in 3 different ways: forEach, while loops, recursion.
The optimized version is not done yet, and is a testing file. It is partially optimized so increase game Size, but as of now it can only
increase the # of boxes per side from from 62 to 71 boxes on my machine.
In the future, performance testing between each version shall be done after dealing with the problem of maximum stack.
